# Translate - a PyTorch Language Library

Translate is a library for machine translation written in PyTorch. It provides training for sequence-to-sequence models. These models can be exported to Caffe2 graphs via [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/), loaded and run from C++ for production purposes. Translate relies on [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq), a general sequence-to-sequence library.

## Requirements and Installation

Translate requires
* A Linux operating system with a CUDA compatible card
* C++ compiler supporting ECMAScript syntax for `<regex>`, such as GCC 4.9 and above.
* A [CUDA installation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/)

To install Translate, please refer to the `install.sh` script. In short, run `bash install.sh`.

## Training

We provide an [example script](https://github.com/pytorch/translate/blob/master/pytorch_translate/examples/train_iwslt14.sh) to train a model for the IWSLT 2014 German-English task. We used this command to obtain [a pretrained model](https://download.pytorch.org/models/translate/iwslt14/model.tar.gz):

```
bash pytorch_translate/examples/train_iwslt14.sh
```

The pretrained model actually contains two checkpoints that correspond to training twice with random initialization of the parameters. This is useful to obtain ensembles.

## Pretrained Model

A pretrained model for IWSLT 2014 can be evaluated by running the [example script](https://github.com/pytorch/translate/blob/master/pytorch_translate/examples/generate_iwslt14.sh):

```
bash pytorch_translate/examples/generate_iwslt14.sh
```

Note the improvement in performance when using an ensemble of size 2 instead of a single model.

## Exporting a Model with ONNX

We provide an [example script](https://github.com/pytorch/translate/blob/master/pytorch_translate/examples/export_iwslt14.sh) to export a PyTorch model to a Caffe2 graph via ONNX:

```
bash pytorch_translate/examples/export_iwslt14.sh
```

## Using the Model

To use the sample exported Caffe2 model to translate sentences, run:

```
echo "hallo welt ." | bash pytorch_translate/examples/translate_iwslt14.sh
```

Note that the model takes in [BPE](https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt)
inputs, so some input words need to be split into multiple tokens.
For instance, "hineinstopfen" is represented as "hinein@@ stop@@ fen".
